# trunic
Translate between English and Trunic - A runic language from the game TUNIC.

This is a work in progress python module and currently only supports
english to trunic translation without symbols or punctuation.

Output methods include trunic to png, or an encoded string that the trunic font
can render appropriately, though the former is not yet reliable.
